    about:
      'At Rapyd Cloud, I contributed to delivering highly trusted managed WordPress hosting, ensuring peak performance for dynamic websites even under heavy traffic. I developed and maintained reusable, high-quality React components to enhance the user interface and overall application performance. Additionally, I integrated Paddle.js for seamless payment processing and Intercom for robust customer support functionality, ensuring a smooth user experience. I also implemented API integrations to facilitate seamless communication between the front-end and back-end services. By incorporating Featurebase, I played a key role in collecting and managing user feedback, which helped improve user satisfaction and feature alignment. I managed the global state using Redux, ensuring efficient data handling and application stability. Furthermore, I mentored junior developers, conducted thorough code reviews, and promoted best practices in code optimization and front-end development.',
